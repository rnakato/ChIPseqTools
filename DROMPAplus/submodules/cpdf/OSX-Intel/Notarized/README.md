The executable in the 'Notarized' directory has been codesigned and notarized
for use on OS X Catalina. At the time of writing, Apple intend that, starting
in January 2020, only such notarized executables will be able to run, no matter
what the owner of the computer thinks.

Furthermore, it is presently impossible to staple the notarization to a single
executable. So, the first time the executable runs, it will phone into Apple to
check it is notarized.
